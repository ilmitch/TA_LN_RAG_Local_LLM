In some cases, if the area of the cathode is small relative to the anode, the additional corrosion may be negligible.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the document, it is acceptable to use aluminum and steel in direct contact, but the design and verification process must include surface treatments or features on a flight hardware to prevent galvanic corrosion. The edges of all metals in exterior locations should be rounded or chamfered to permit adhesion of an adequate thickness of protective coatings, and drainage and airflow should be provided to prevent collection and entrapment of rain, seawater, or other unwanted fluids.\\n\\nGalvanic compatibility must also be evaluated at the assembly level in accordance with the requirements from clause 5.2 of this standard and requirements from clause 5.1.12 of ECSS -Q-ST-70. The document provides tables and notes to help designers and engineers evaluate and mitigate the risk of galvanic corrosion in their designs.\\n\\nIn summary, while it is acceptable to use aluminum and steel in direct contact, proper design and verification processes must be followed to prevent galvanic corrosion and ensure the overall integrity of the spacecraft or satellite.',\n",
       " ['ECSS -Q-ST-70-14C 1 November 2016  Annex A  (informative)  Corrosion  A.1 Overview  The majority of corrosion reactions involve a metal in the presence of water and oxygen.  Consider the corrosion of iron or steel in a natural water. The reaction proceeds as follows:  2Fe + O 2 + 2H 2O \\uf0e0 2Fe(OH) 2 (1)   Equation (1) summarises the overall reaction but it is made up from two independent half -reactions ( the oxidation of iron, anodic reaction (1a ), and the reduction of oxygen and water, cathodic reaction (1b)  ) i.e.                      2Fe \\uf0e0 2Fe2+ + 4 e- (1a)  O2 + 2H 2O + 4e- \\uf0e0 4OH  (1b)  In a real system the iron hydroxide usually oxidises further to form either magnetite (Fe3O4) or a hydrated ferric oxide (FeOOH), but if the initial oxidation of the iron can be stopped or reduced then a steel structure can be protected. The principles behind many corrosion protection methods depend on interfering with this reaction.   A.2 The eight forms of corrosio n A.2.1 General corrosion  General corrosion, or uniform attack, is one of the most common causes of corrosion.  It is characterised by its relatively uniform progress through a structure usually over a large area.  A.2.2 Galvanic corrosion  Galvanic, sometimes referred t o as bimetallic, corrosion can occur when two metals are in contact both electrically and via an electrolyte.  Two metals placed into the same solution achieve different potentials. If the metals are electrically connected to each other then they are  at the  same potential, somewhere between the two unconnected potentials.  This change in potential is referred to 26',\n",
       "  'ECSS -Q-ST-70-14C 1 November 2016  as polarisation, and results in the corrosion of the more active metal being driven harder whilst the more noble metal is protected. This phenomenon can be taken advantage of in corrosion protection, when a more active metal is used to coat a structural material such as zinc galvanising on steel, with the zinc corroding preferentially and protecting the underlying steel.  The amount of corrosion experienced by the active, anodic, metal depends on the corrosion current being provided by the non -corroding cathode. This leads to the effect that galvanic corrosion can be reduced by coating the cathodic, non- corroding, material. In many cases, if the area of the cathode is small relative to the anode the additional corrosion is negligible. For example: stainless steel screws in an aluminium structure that can  be considered a problem according to ECSS -Q-ST-70. In practice stainless steel screws are commonly use d without any problems because the small area of steel relative to the large area of aluminium structure means that the current density driving corrosion is low and the effects are negligible. A.2.3 Crevice corrosion  Localised corrosion frequently occurs within crevices or other shielded features where small quantities of an electrolyte can stagnate.  Restricted access means that any oxygen in the crevice is used up relatively quickly, stifling the local cathodic reactions.  The cathodic reaction continues outside the crevice, and so provides a balance to the anodic reaction continuing within the crevice and putting metal ions into solution.  Without the cathodic reaction within the crevice producing hydroxyl ions there is soon an excess of positively charged metal i ons. These ions attract negatively charged ions, particularly the very mobile chlorides, into the crevice and form metal chlorides. In aqueous',\n",

The concept of inertial resistance torque is important in the design and operation of spacecraft, as it affects their stability and control during flight.\\n\\nThe question asks for a definition of inertial resistance torque, but unfortunately, the provided documents do not provide a clear explanation or definition of this term. The documents focus primarily on the analysis and design of spacecraft dynamics and control systems, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts involved.\\n\\nTherefore, I must conclude that the question is unknown, and there is no definitive answer to provide. However, I can suggest some possible sources where you may find more information on inertial resistance torque:\\n\\n1. Spacecraft Dynamics and Control Books: There are several books available that cover the basics of spacecraft dynamics and control, including \"Spacecraft Dynamics and Control\" by J. D. McCoy and \"Control of Spacecraft\" by R. E. Batchelor. These books may provide a more detailed explanation of inertial resistance torque.\\n2. Aerospace Engineering Textbooks: Textbooks on aerospace engineering may also cover the topic of inertial resistance torque, as it is an important aspect of spacecraft design and operation. Some examples include \"Aerospace Engineering\" by R. E. Lewis and \"Fundamentals of Aerospace Engineering\" by J. P. Hansman.\\n3. Scientific Papers: Research papers published in scientific journals may also discuss the concept of inertial resistance torque in the context of spacecraft dynamics and control. You can search for relevant papers using databases such as NASA\\'s Technical Reports Server or the IEEE Xplore database.\\n4. Online Forums and Discussion Groups: Participating in online forums and discussion groups focused on spacecraft dynamics and control can provide opportunities to ask questions and learn from experts in the field.

       " ['ECSS‐E‐HB‐31‐01  Part 7A  5 December  2011  109 6 Multilayer insulations 6.1 General A multilayer  insulation  (MLI)  consists of several layers  of closely spaced radiation ‐reflecting  shields which are placed perpendicular  to the heat flow direction.  These  radiation  shields aim at reflecting  a large percentage  of the radiation  the layer receives from a warmer surface.  To avoid direct contact between shields, low‐conductivity  spacers  ma y be used.  Sometimes  embossing  or crinkling  the shields produces  small contact areas whose  thermal joint conductance  is low enough to keep conductive  heat transfer between shields substantially  below radiative  heat transfer.  The space  between  shields is evacuated  to decrease  gas conduction.  For space applications,  proper venting of the insulation  inner space  sh ould be provided  to avoid undue pressure  loads on the shields during  ascent flight, to achieve an effective repressurization  during re‐entry, and to deliver  outgassing  from the insulation  materials  when long‐ term on‐orbit missions  are contemplated.   One‐dimensional  heat transfer testing has shown (Figure 6‐1) that  an evacuate d MLI provides,  for a given mass, insulation  which is orders of magnitude  greater  than that furnished  by more  conventional  materials  such as foams and fiber‐glass  batting.',\n",
       "  'ECSS -E-HB-31-03A  15 November 2016   Annex A  Specific guidelines A.1 Multilayer insulation  A.1.1 Introduction  Multilayer insulation (MLI) is a thermal control element composed of several stacked thin foils. These foils are separated (by embossi ng, crinkling or a spacer net) so that their contact area is small and the conductive path through the stack is minimised. The foils have low infrared emissivity, achieved by a deposition of thin metal layers such as aluminium and gold. This results in a v ery low overall radiative conductance through the stack.  The heat transfer through the MLI is composed of radiation between each foil and conduction through contact areas.  As MLI are complex structures  and real conditions can strongly influence its charact eristics. In particular the detailed design of MLI leads to areas of higher compression (fixations) and edges, seams etc. where the MLI performance is locally reduced. Therefore it is recommended that MLI characteristics values are considered with caution  and suitable sensitivity analysis is carried out (see section 6). A.1.2 Modelling principles  The thermal modelling of a MLI usually focuses on the through- thickness heat fluxes. It is recommended that  the model accurately represent s the following data:  • temperature of the external foils T 1 and T2, and  • heat flux from one side to the other . If the MLI is mounted flat on a surface, it is possible to avoid modelling the MLI foil in contact with the surface : in this case all coupling s are between the MLI outer foil and the thermal node representing the surface.  Where possible,  it is recommended that th e nodal pattern of the MLI external match es the one of the underlying surface. This avoids ar tificial coupling between nodes and spurious thermal “shortcuts” which do not exist in practice.  The modeller is advised to check that in -plane phenomena can be ne glected, especially for MLI with a small area.  58',\n",
       "  'ECSS‐E‐HB‐31‐01  Part 7A  5 December  2011  112 \\uf028\\uf02934 44C HC HT TT TT\\uf02d\\uf02d\\uf03d   [6‐3]  The effective thermal conductivity  of a multilayer  insulation  is, loosely speaking,  inversely  proportional  to the number of radiation  shields per unit  thickness,  N/t, while the effective emittance  is inversely  proportional  to N. The reason is that for an ideal system without radiation ‐absorbing  spacers the radiative  heat tra nsfer  decreases  as 1/N. The measurements  indicate that the real behavior  of most MLIs deviates from the ideal one when N/t increases,  due to increased  thermal conduction  between adjacent layers.  Most of the heat transfer data presented  in this compilation  are based on keff, with the only exception  of data giving the effect of surface perturbations  on the characteristics  of the MLI (such as overlaps,  stitches, buttons, ...), which are based on \\uf065eff,.  6.1.2 Failure modes Failure of a multilayer  insulation  system can only occur by physical removal from the guarded surface.  Performance  can be degraded  by compression,  exposure  to moisture  and elevated temperatures,  or improper  handling  techniques.   Blankets  should be manufactured  and manipulated  in clean rooms, with a humidity  range of 40‐60% and a temperature  ra nge between  288 and 300 K. Persons handling  the blankets and associated  material should wear normal clear room clothing and flint‐free gloves. For transportation  purposes,  the blankets should be welded  in plastic bags containing  silica  gel packages.   The shielding  of aluminium  foil or aluminized  Mylar  ignite both in oxygen and ai r atmospheres.  The inflammability  and explosiveness  of packs of multilayer  insulation  with glass‐fiber spacing can be reduced by lowering  the content of organic  additives  in the spacer.  6.1.3 Heat transfer through an MLI Heat is transferred  from the hot to the cold face of an MLI by the three usual  mechanisms,  namely: (a) radiation,  (b) solid  conduction;  and (c) gas conduction.',\n",

Outgassing  rates of spacer materials  are given in  6.10 Complete systems As it has emphasized  repeatedly,  the calculation  of the insulation  characteristics  of an MLI is a difficult task. Hence it seems useful  to collect as many experimental  data as possible on the performance  of existing systems.  This collection  is the objective  of clauses  6.11 to 6.17.  Ideally an MLI system is supposed  to be placed  normally  to the temperature  gradient,  so that most of the data  presented  regard  the performance  of ideal systems  as measured  on normal calorimeters  (Clause 6.11). However,  thermal conducti vities obtained  on spacecraft  can be considerably  higher than those obtained  in an idealized  system, because of the discontinuities  which are necessarily  introduced  in real configurations.  Information  on non‐normal heat transfer is given in Clause 6.12. The e ffect  of singularities  such as overlaps,  stitches and patches appears in Clause 6.13. In addit ion to these discontinuities,  which  are introduced  during  the assembling  process, holes may be made in the shields to ease evacuation.  These holes increase the shield transmittance,  and consequently  the thermal conductivity  of the system. Data on the degrading  effect of these holes are presented  in Clause 6.14.  A limited amount of information  on the effect of other type of holes,  those introduced  because of mechanical  damage,  is given in clause 6.15.  An important point concerns  the effect of the inner  gas on the blanket  thermal conductivity.  This gas may be either air, a purge gas, or species absorbed  or adsorbed  in the system.  Since MLI systems exhibit low thermal conductivity  when evacuated,  two questions  arise: 1. How the inner  gas degrades  the thermal performa nce of the system  (clause 6.16), and',\n",

      "Threaded fastener joints represent critical areas within structures and it is evident that a  \n",
      "standardised methodology is needed for their design.  \n",
      "Thus, the aims of this document are:  \n",
      " to bring together into one document a reliable and systematic design procedure to aid the designer and improve the efficiency of the design process, and  \n",
      " to provide an approved and reliable design procedure that  can reduce the possibility of \n",
      "design errors and subsequent structural failure.  \n",
      "This document addresses these aims with particular reference to Space Structures and related hardware. This constraint is reflected in the range of joint geometries covered and structural applications, and also the range of fastener types and materials for which data is presented.  \n",
      "• PURPOSE OF THIS ISSUE  \n",
      "ESA PSS- 03-208 (December 1989) “Guidelines for threaded fasteners”, on which this document is \n",
      "based, provided a number of methodologies for analysis of threaded fastener joints in spacecraft structures. This document is Revis ion 1 of ECSS -E-HB- 32-23A which was based on the ESA PSS \n",
      "document  taking into account more recent developments in the field. It is intended to standardise \n",
      "the analysis approach and corresponding documentation for threaded fastener joints developed in ECSS projects. Therefore, this document presents a “Margin of Safety” for each mode of failure \n",
      "that are good practice to  be considered. It is important that a ll relevant margins of safety are\n",

These variations come under the following broad categories:  • Process Variations  • Material Variations  • Tole rancing  It is important that t he designer specifies  the acceptable variation of the above parameters in the engineering drawings, also citing the relevant company, national or international standards.  Production testing and inspection is an important part of Quality Control and it provides feedback on achievement and limits variations. It is important that t he designer therefore consider s the necessary testing and inspection and facilitate this (as far as possible) within the design.  15.3.2  Process Variations The performance of the threaded fastener joints is affected by the following:  a. Dimensional tolerances, e.g. fastener/hole fits, hole positional tolerances.  b. Surface finish on the mating part of the design.  c. Preload variations.  d. Thread profil e and dimensional tolerances.  e. Lubrication conditions.  The above variations are limited by the designer specifying an acceptable level on the drawings or by invoking standards.  15.3.3  Material Variations Performance of the joint can be affected by the following material variations:  a. Ultimate strength (compressive and tensile)  b. Proof strength (compressive and tensile)  c. Moduli of the material  d. Poisson Ratio  e. Friction characteristics  f. Corrosion characteristics',\n",

It is also impo rtant to specify r olled threads , and in particular, thread rolling and cold working of the under head radius is  carried out as the final manufacturing operation to guarantee beneficial compressive stresses.  11.2.3.4 Assembly Methods Preload is the most important joint parameter in resisting external loads (see Section  6). It is important to use  the most accurate preloading method (appropriate to the assembly)  together with a dry lubrication system that gives the most consistent (rather t han the lowest) friction conditions.  It is important to measure p revailing torque during each assembly operation and that torque is added to the torque specified for preloading.  11.2.3.5 Surface Finish Defects and Other Damage  It is import ant to pay s pecial attention to surface finish and Non Destructive Inspection (NDI) procedures for safe life PFCI  fasteners. Fatigue life can be greatly reduced by flaws, scratches or abrasions arising either during manufacturing or while in service.  Other effects that are important to  be considered are differential thermal stresses, stress corrosion and fretti ng under load.',\n",

This document provides additional information for the application of standards ECSS -E-ST-32 (Structural general requirements) , ECSS -E-ST-32-01 (Fracture control)  and ECSS -E-ST-32-10 (Structural factors of safety  for spaceflight hardware) . • BACKGROUND  Threaded fastener joints represent critical areas within structures and it is evident that a  standardised methodology is needed for their design.  Thus, the aims of this document are:  \\uf8e7 to bring together into one document a reliable and systematic design procedure to aid the designer and improve the efficiency of the design process, and  \\uf8e7 to provide an approved and reliable design procedure that  can reduce the possibility of design errors and subsequent structural failure.  This document addresses these aims with particular reference to Space Structures and related hardware. This constraint is reflected in the range of joint geometries covered and structural applications, and also the range of fastener types and materials for which data is presented.  • PURPOSE OF THIS ISSUE  ESA PSS- 03-208 (December 1989) “Guidelines for threaded fasteners”, on which this document is based, provided a number of methodologies for analysis of threaded fastener joints in spacecraft structures. This document is Revis ion 1 of ECSS -E-HB- 32-23A which was based on the ESA PSS document  taking into account more recent developments in the field. It is intended to standardise the analysis approach and corresponding documentation for threaded fastener joints developed in ECSS projects. Therefore, this document presents a “Margin of Safety” for each mode of failure that are good practice to  be considered. It is important that a ll relevant margins of safety are',\n",

Preferably, fasteners be designed and verified to be fail safe.  According to ECSS -E-ST-32-01 threaded fasteners can only be considered ‘low risk’ when the stress (incl. preload) does not exceed 0,3  x UTS during the life, which limits this category generally to threaded fasteners used as shear pins with low preload.  Safe life fasten ers have to be sufficiently large in diameter (minimum 5mm but preferably larger) and of the highest aerospace quality manufactured from A286 steel, Inconel 718, MP35 N alloy or similarly tough and environmentally compatible alloys.  It is important that fracture critical (or low risk) bolts in tension applications are not been fabricated from low fracture toughness alloys or specifically titanium (unless agreed otherwise, see below).  The eddy current method is the preferred method for inspection of fracture  critical threaded fasteners. General guidance can be found in the ECSS -Q-ST-70-15C (Ref. 11.14) on NDT, more specific information can be found in e.g. NASA -JSC PRC 6509 (Ref. 11.15). The associated standard surface crack size for eddy current is: depth a= 1,27mm, length 2c=2,54mm. Dye penetrant inspection is generally considered insufficient, because rolled threads, and other rolled radii cannot be etched as normally required before penetrant inspection for fracture control, in order to avoid degradation of  the fastener quality. Penetrant inspection is sometimes performed without etching, but more as a general quality check instead of basis for safe life analysis.  In case preloaded fasteners without threads rolled after all thermal treatment of the material be used, in agreement with the customer, in addition to the crack size associated with the NDI, also a so -called',\n",

Ultrasound waves are created in the cleaning bath via oscillators located at the base or side walls and spread longitudinally through the cleaning agent. Due to the fact that a pressure below vapour  pressure prevails  during the oscillation phase, vapour -filled bubbles',\n",

There are several variations  of this technique,  but all of them have the disadvantage  that the vacuum is applied only in short pulses and the procedure  may have to be repeated  several times. In addition,  since the work is performed  with two different  devices simultaneously,  i.e. soldering  iron  and sucker tip (refer  to Figure  B‐2), this method finds only limited use.

The following  apparatus  shall be used to perform a tape‐lift analysis:  1. A low‐tack, transparent  adhesive  tape with an adhesive  force  of less than 0,3 N/mm. 2. A tape that is free of particles,  voids,  bubbles, and other artefacts detrimental  to the counting  of particles.  3. A membrane  filt er  with a pore size less than 1 µm, and a minimum  diameter  of 5 cm, which provides  contrast with the particulate  contaminants  being analyzed.  NOTE  The choice  of the membrane  filter depends  upon  the nature  of the particles being analysed (e.g.  a white membrane  filter  in the case of black particles and a black membrane  filter  in the case of white particles).  Membrane  filters can have grids when  statistical  counting  is used. 4. A mask or gridded membrane  filter to perform statistical  counting  on squares of pre‐defined  area. 5. Non‐shedding  and lint‐free gloves. 6. Tweezers. 7. Scis sors  or a scalpel. 8. A clean container  for the transport  of the tape‐lift sample to the measurement  facility. NOTE 1 A clean container  is a container  devoid of particulate  that could influence  the measurement  of the tape‐lift sample. NOTE 2 The container  can be sealed to prevent external contamination  from reaching  the internal parts of the container.  5.1.1.4 Tape-lift method a. Application  of the adhesive  tape to the surface to be analysed  shall be performed  as follows: 1. Remove with a velocity not exceeding  1 cm/s a minimum  of 6 cm to 10 cm of the low tack, transparent  adhesive  tape from the tape roll. NOTE  The reason  to remove the tap e slowly  from the roll is to minimise  static electricity. 2.

      "\n",
      "1. Access control: The standard requires an access control system to be available independently for cleanrooms, storage areas, and equipment airlocks. Only authorized personnel shall have access to the cleanroom, and visitors and personnel without a work order shall not be allowed to enter the cleanroom. Visitors working in the cleanroom must wear the complete clothing, be identifiable, and be instructed about the behavior in a cleanroom.\n",
      "2. Materials: The standard advises against taking contaminating materials into the cleanroom. If in doubt about the suitability of any given material, the relevant Planetary Protection Responsible Engineer/Manager should be consulted. All cleanroom consumables (wipes, solvents, detergents, swabs, etc.) used for surface cleaning should be dedicated and approved items.\n",
      "3. Cleanliness: The standard requires the cleanliness after cleaning operations to be verified by inspection using UV or high-intensity white light. Any personnel involved in cleaning operations must be trained and informed about the criticality of a cleaning operation within a cleanroom.\n",
      "4. Equipment: The standard recommends that cleaning tools, solvents, and gases used for cleaning purposes shall be chosen not to have a detrimental effect on the hardware within the cleanroom.\n",
      "5. Airlocks: The standard requires that cleanroom air of better than class ISO 8 is transported in a close loop. Excessive use of solvents offgassing into the air, even if not flammable or toxic, can cause health problems.\n",
      "6. Contamination control: The standard outlines procedures for corrective actions when the level of contamination exceeds the cleanliness requirements specification.\n",
      "7. Identification: The standard requires that visitors and personnel without a work order shall not be allowed to enter the cleanroom. Lint-free clothing must be worn by all personnel within the cleanroom area.\n",
      "8. Separation: The standard advises that barriers or similar means separating clean and not clean zones inside the airlock shall be placed, and racks or cabinets for street clothing shall be separated from those used for cleanroom clothing.\n",
      "9. Training: The standard requires that all personnel involved in cleaning operations must be trained and informed about the criticality of a cleaning operation within a cleanroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the ECSS-Q-ST-70-01C standard provides strict guidelines for maintaining a cleanroom environment, including access control, material handling, cleanliness verification, equipment selection, airlock procedures, contamination control, identification, separation, and training.\n",

       "['The ECSS-Q-ST-70-01C standard provides guidelines for the cleanliness and access control in a cleanroom environment. Here are some of the key points from the standard:\\n\\n1. Access control: The standard requires an access control system to be available independently for cleanrooms, storage areas, and equipment airlocks. Only authorized personnel shall have access to the cleanroom, and visitors and personnel without a work order shall not be allowed to enter the cleanroom. Visitors working in the cleanroom must wear the complete clothing, be identifiable, and be instructed about the behavior in a cleanroom.\\n2. Materials: The standard advises against taking contaminating materials into the cleanroom. If in doubt about the suitability of any given material, the relevant Planetary Protection Responsible Engineer/Manager should be consulted. All cleanroom consumables (wipes, solvents, detergents, swabs, etc.) used for surface cleaning should be dedicated and approved items.\\n3. Cleanliness: The standard requires the cleanliness after cleaning operations to be verified by inspection using UV or high-intensity white light. Any personnel involved in cleaning operations must be trained and informed about the criticality of a cleaning operation within a cleanroom.\\n4. Equipment: The standard recommends that cleaning tools, solvents, and gases used for cleaning purposes shall be chosen not to have a detrimental effect on the hardware within the cleanroom.\\n5. Airlocks: The standard requires that cleanroom air of better than class ISO 8 is transported in a close loop. Excessive use of solvents offgassing into the air, even if not flammable or toxic, can cause health problems.\\n6. Contamination control: The standard outlines procedures for corrective actions when the level of contamination exceeds the cleanliness requirements specification.\\n7. Identification: The standard requires that visitors and personnel without a work order shall not be allowed to enter the cleanroom. Lint-free clothing must be worn by all personnel within the cleanroom area.\\n8. Separation: The standard advises that barriers or similar means separating clean and not clean zones inside the airlock shall be placed, and racks or cabinets for street clothing shall be separated from those used for cleanroom clothing.\\n9. Training: The standard requires that all personnel involved in cleaning operations must be trained and informed about the criticality of a cleaning operation within a cleanroom.\\n\\nIn summary, the ECSS-Q-ST-70-01C standard provides strict guidelines for maintaining a cleanroom environment, including access control, material handling, cleanliness verification, equipment selection, airlock procedures, contamination control, identification, separation, and training.',\n",

Other personal  effects such as tobacco products,  purses, wallets, spectacle  cases, car or door keys, currency,  etc. i. Unauthorized  writing implements  (certain pens, pencils, marker pens). E.6.2.6. Audits Periodic audits of the cleanroom  for presence  of non‐ compliant  materials  should be performed.  E.6.3 Working practises E.6.3.1. Locomotion Movements  within the cleanroom  should be slow and controlled.  Erratic and rapid movements  generate  more  particulate  contamination  and disturb the optimum  airflow. E.6.3.2. Housekeeping Good housekeeping  is important.  Areas where items are closely positioned  or cluttered  act as contamination  traps and the result is stagnant  air pockets which are not removed  by the normal unimpeded  airflow. E.6.3.3. Positioning of personnel Personnel  should be positioned  down‐stream of the air flow past  the product.  Leaning over  the product increases  the risk of particulate,  organic  and microbial contamination.  Talking whilst facing or leaning over the hardware  should not be permitted,  even when wearing full face masks. Personnel  should not cough  or sneeze whilst still facing critical hardware.  If coughing  or sneezing  is unavoidable,  the face  should be turned  away. Masks should be replaced  after any such incident.  E.6.3.4. Planning Before carrying out any  operation  in the cleanroom,  the activity(s)  should be thought through  and pre‐planned in order  to minimize  contamination  potential.  E.6.3.5. Hand-carried objects When hand‐carrying items in the cleanroom,  these should not be held tight against the cleanroom  garments,  e.g. pulled into the stomach or chest, or under one arm.  The outside of the garments  are not 100 % clean, and friction between the object being carried and the garment generates  particles  and fibres. These',\n",

Numbers  of personnel  within the cleanroom  should be kept  to the minimum  necessary  at any one time. NOTE  Contamination  levels and contamination  potential  increase as the number of personnel  increase.  E.6.2.2. Untrained Personnel/Visitors Untrained  personnel  or casual visitors should not be permitted  Only fully trained personnel  or trainee personnel  under  appropriate  trained supervision  should be permitted  access. E.6.2.3. Access routing Personnel  should use the designated  personnel  access route only to the cleanroom,  via the changing,  antiseptic  wash and gowning  area. Access via equipment  or hardware  transfer ante‐rooms (e.g.  those routes used  for large MGSE etc.) should not be used as an alternative  means of access into the bioburden  controlled  area.

      "1. Terminology: The latest revision of ECSS -E-ST-32-01C (Rev. 2) uses more updated terminology than the previous revision (ECSS -E-ST-32-01). For example, the term \"potential fracture-critical item\" (PFCI) is used in Rev. 2 instead of \"fracture-critical item\" (FCI) in Rev. 1.\n",
      "2. Structure: The structure of ECSS -E-ST-32-01C Rev. 2 is more detailed and organized than the structure of ECSS -E-ST-32-01. Rev. 2 has separate sections for each aspect of fracture control, such as \"Fracture Control Program,\" \"Fracture Control Identification and Evaluation,\" and \"Special Requirements.\" Rev. 1, on the other hand, has a more general structure with fewer sections.\n",
      "3. Definitions and Abbreviations: Both revisions provide definitions and abbreviations for terms related to fracture control. However, Rev. 2 includes more detailed explanations of the abbreviations and their meanings.\n",
      "4. Fracture Control Program: The FCP in Rev. 2 is more detailed than in Rev. 1. Rev. 2 includes specific requirements for the structure of the FCP, such as organization and responsibilities, as well as links with higher and lower (assembly) level plans. Rev. 1 does not include these details.\n",
      "5. Identification and Evaluation of PFCI: Rev. 2 provides more detailed requirements for identifying and evaluating PFCIs than Rev. 1. Rev. 2 includes specific requirements for the analysis and tests of PFCIs, such as safe life, fail safe, containment, and LBB. Rev. 1 does not include these details.\n",
      "6. Special Requirements: Rev. 2 includes more special requirements than Rev. 1, such as non-standard approaches and dedicated approaches (e.g., reduced fracture control program). Rev. 1 does not include these details.\n",
      "7. Material Data: Rev. 2 provides more detailed requirements for material data than Rev. 1. Rev. 2 includes specific requirements for the definition of fatigue load spectrum, analysis, and tests of PFCI's (safe life, fail safe, containment, LBB). Rev. 1 does not include these details.\n",
      "8. Hazard Analysis and Structural Screening: Rev. 2 includes more detailed requirements for hazard analysis and structural screening than Rev. 1. Rev. 2 requires repeated hazard analysis and structural screening to ensure compatibility with current design and service-life scenario. Rev. 1 does not include these details.\n",

       "['The content of ECSS -E-ST-32-01C Rev. 2 (30 July 2021) and ECSS -E-ST-32-01 (15 November 2008) are similar, but there are some differences in the terminology and structure of the documents. Here are some key differences:\\n\\n1. Terminology: The latest revision of ECSS -E-ST-32-01C (Rev. 2) uses more updated terminology than the previous revision (ECSS -E-ST-32-01). For example, the term \"potential fracture-critical item\" (PFCI) is used in Rev. 2 instead of \"fracture-critical item\" (FCI) in Rev. 1.\\n2. Structure: The structure of ECSS -E-ST-32-01C Rev. 2 is more detailed and organized than the structure of ECSS -E-ST-32-01. Rev. 2 has separate sections for each aspect of fracture control, such as \"Fracture Control Program,\" \"Fracture Control Identification and Evaluation,\" and \"Special Requirements.\" Rev. 1, on the other hand, has a more general structure with fewer sections.\\n3. Definitions and Abbreviations: Both revisions provide definitions and abbreviations for terms related to fracture control. However, Rev. 2 includes more detailed explanations of the abbreviations and their meanings.\\n4. Fracture Control Program: The FCP in Rev. 2 is more detailed than in Rev. 1. Rev. 2 includes specific requirements for the structure of the FCP, such as organization and responsibilities, as well as links with higher and lower (assembly) level plans. Rev. 1 does not include these details.\\n5. Identification and Evaluation of PFCI: Rev. 2 provides more detailed requirements for identifying and evaluating PFCIs than Rev. 1. Rev. 2 includes specific requirements for the analysis and tests of PFCIs, such as safe life, fail safe, containment, and LBB. Rev. 1 does not include these details.\\n6. Special Requirements: Rev. 2 includes more special requirements than Rev. 1, such as non-standard approaches and dedicated approaches (e.g., reduced fracture control program). Rev. 1 does not include these details.\\n7. Material Data: Rev. 2 provides more detailed requirements for material data than Rev. 1. Rev. 2 includes specific requirements for the definition of fatigue load spectrum, analysis, and tests of PFCI\\'s (safe life, fail safe, containment, LBB). Rev. 1 does not include these details.\\n8. Hazard Analysis and Structural Screening: Rev. 2 includes more detailed requirements for hazard analysis and structural screening than Rev. 1. Rev. 2 requires repeated hazard analysis and structural screening to ensure compatibility with current design and service-life scenario. Rev. 1 does not include these details.\\n\\nIn summary, ECSS -E-ST-32-01C Rev. 2 provides more detailed and organized requirements for fracture control than ECSS -E-ST-32-01. Rev. 2 includes more special requirements, such as non-standard approaches and dedicated approaches, and provides more detailed explanations of the abbreviations and their meanings.',\n",

       "['\\nBased on the provided documents, the answer to the question \"What coating can\\'t be used for space hardware?\" is unknown. The ECSS-Q-ST-70-17C standard does not provide a definitive answer to this question as it focuses on specifying requirements for the durability testing of coatings commonly used for space applications, rather than providing a comprehensive list of coatings that can or cannot be used for space hardware.\\n\\nThe standard does mention that some coatings may not meet the requirements specified in the standard, and therefore may not be suitable for use in space applications (Section 7). However, it does not provide a list of specific coatings that are not suitable for space use.\\n\\nTherefore, to determine which coatings cannot be used for space hardware, additional research and analysis would be necessary, taking into account the specific requirements and constraints of the space project in question.',\n",
       " ['ECSS -Q-ST-70-17C 1 February 2018  Introduction  Many different environmental factors can have an effect on coating durability  for space applications . This includes in -orbit effects such as thermal cycling and particle radiation,  as we ll as ground based effects such as cleaning, contamination and humidity. Space projects have  typically been free to choose their own test requirements, based on a combination of existing standards and specific requirements for a given project. This approach can lead to ambiguous  definition s about when a coating is “space qualified”. The supplier and customer often re- negotiate very general aspects of coating quali fication for each new project. The  intention of  the present  standard is to c apture the best practice across the large range of existing national and international standards, in order to specify a minimum set of durability requirements for coating use in space applications. Information is a lso provided about some mission specific tests  (including the atomic oxygen test, thermal ageing test, air -vacuum test and solar illumination test ). 7',\n",
       "  'ECSS -Q-ST-70-17C 1 February 2018  1 Scope This standard specifies requirements for the durability testing of  coating s most commonly used for s pace applications , i.e.: • Thin film optical coatings  • Thermo -optical and thermal control coatings ( the majority are paints,  metallic deposits  and coatings  for stray light reduction)  • Metallic coatings  for other applications (RF, electrical, corrosion protection)  This standard covers testing for both ground and in- orbit  phases of a space mission.  This standard includes  coatings within off -the-shelf items This standard specifies the types of test to be performed for each class of coating, covering the different phases of a space project ( evaluation , qualification and acceptance)  This standard does not cover : • The particular qualification requirements for a s pecific mission  • Specific functional testing requirements for the different coating classes  • Test requirements for long term storage  • Solar cell cover glass coatings  • Surface treatments and conformal coatings applied on EEE parts  This standard may be tailored for the specific characteristic and constrains o f a space project in conformance with ECSS -S-ST-00. 8',\n",
       "  'ECSS -Q-ST-70-17C 1 February 2018  D.10  Contamination effects  Molecular contamination can be deposited onto optical coatings due to vacuum outgassing from nearby organic materials on the spacecraft. In general, this effect is not associated with the d urability of the coating itself but rather the external environment. However, in some cases the coating design can change the affinity of the molecules to stick to the surface, especially in the presence of UV radiation. Testing can then be performed to as sess the response of different types of coating under controlled contamination flux.  D.11  Solar illumination  In some non- nominal operating modes, t he space craft  attitude can deviate , pointing the optical axis  towards the s un. After reflection on M1 and M2 mirro rs, solar fluxes are focused on the t elescope front and rear cavity , reaching the detectors. The solar spot received by the i nstrument elements is defined by its heat flux density, surface  area and the scrolling rate.  The objective of the solar illumination test is to confirm that exposed coatings are able to withstand the short term temperature increase induced by this  solar illumination. The testing conditions are given by the thermal simulations and the project specification.  42'],\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Induced Magnetic Moment Measurement: This method is used to measure the induced magnetic moment of a Device Under Test (DUT). The test involves applying a known magnetic field and measuring the resulting magnetic moment in two opposite orientations. The difference between the moments gives twice the induced magnetic moment, while the remanent magnetic moments cancel out.\n",
      "2. Multiple Dipole Model (MDM) Measurement: In this method, the EUT is installed on a turntable and rotated in front of one or several fixed 3-axes magnetometers. The field values are acquired at regular angular steps over a whole 360° turn. A software code implementing a non-linear optimization method like Gauss-Newton is used to fit the MDM to the measurement data.\n",
      "3. Battery Magnetic Moment Measurement: This test aims to measure the magnetic moment of a battery, which has three components: static, dynamic, and induced magnetic moments. The static moment is measured after discharging the battery at its maximum rate, the dynamic moment while discharging through a resistor at its maximum rate, and the induced magnetic moment under an external field before and after applying a demagnetizing field on each axis for a given time.\n",
      "4. Battery Corona Testing: This test is carried out to verify the absence of corona effects for high voltage batteries. The battery is placed in a vacuum chamber at 20°C, and a power supply is connected between the battery negative power connection and the ground reference point. The pressure is decreased down to 10-3 mbar at a specified rate, and the absence of arcing is shown by the absence of fluctuations in the power supply voltage throughout the battery corona test.\n",
      "5. Environmental Tests: The objectives of these tests are to establish technology limitations and verify the suitability of cells or batteries for target applications and missions, as well as to verify their initial capabilities.\n",

       "[\" The given text discusses various magnetic moment measurement techniques for ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing of devices under different conditions. Here's a summary of the methods mentioned:\\n\\n1. Induced Magnetic Moment Measurement: This method is used to measure the induced magnetic moment of a Device Under Test (DUT). The test involves applying a known magnetic field and measuring the resulting magnetic moment in two opposite orientations. The difference between the moments gives twice the induced magnetic moment, while the remanent magnetic moments cancel out.\\n2. Multiple Dipole Model (MDM) Measurement: In this method, the EUT is installed on a turntable and rotated in front of one or several fixed 3-axes magnetometers. The field values are acquired at regular angular steps over a whole 360° turn. A software code implementing a non-linear optimization method like Gauss-Newton is used to fit the MDM to the measurement data.\\n3. Battery Magnetic Moment Measurement: This test aims to measure the magnetic moment of a battery, which has three components: static, dynamic, and induced magnetic moments. The static moment is measured after discharging the battery at its maximum rate, the dynamic moment while discharging through a resistor at its maximum rate, and the induced magnetic moment under an external field before and after applying a demagnetizing field on each axis for a given time.\\n4. Battery Corona Testing: This test is carried out to verify the absence of corona effects for high voltage batteries. The battery is placed in a vacuum chamber at 20°C, and a power supply is connected between the battery negative power connection and the ground reference point. The pressure is decreased down to 10-3 mbar at a specified rate, and the absence of arcing is shown by the absence of fluctuations in the power supply voltage throughout the battery corona test.\\n5. Environmental Tests: The objectives of these tests are to establish technology limitations and verify the suitability of cells or batteries for target applications and missions, as well as to verify their initial capabilities.\",\n",

In the absence of closed -loop ambient field compensation, the measurement should be performed as close as possible to the DUT. The smallest test distance is achievable when testing small parts or electronic components that are not bigger than a couple of centi metres. The minimal test distance is then limited not only by the size of the DUT, but also by the physical size of the sensors (typically also a couple of centimetres). Below a certain test distance, the magnetic field from the DUT is not homogeneous any more over the sensor, and the measurement is biased by an integration effect. In practice the minimum test distance is in the order of 8 cm to 15  cm between the centre of the DUT and the centre of the closest fluxgate sensor. mimrmBapp +BappmimrmBapp -Bapp+mBapp +-mBapp -2mi(a) (b) (c)',\n",

In the absence of closed -loop ambient field compensation, the measurement should be performed as close as possible to the DUT. The smallest test distance is achievable when testing small parts or electronic components that are not bigger than a couple of centi metres. The minimal test distance is then limited not only by the size of the DUT, but also by the physical size of the sensors (typically also a couple of centimetres). Below a certain test distance, the magnetic field from the DUT is not homogeneous any more over the sensor, and the measurement is biased by an integration effect. In practice the minimum test distance is in the order of 8 cm to 15  cm between the centre of the DUT and the centre of the closest fluxgate sensor. mimrmBapp +BappmimrmBapp -Bapp+mBapp +-mBapp -2mi(a) (b) (c)',\n",

Off -setting the component under test from the rotation axis and putting the magnetometer above it is a possible way of forcing a pseudo -sinusoidal signature at each sensor, favouring good magnetic moment identificatio n. Measuring the magnetic field every deg, or every 2 deg, instead of every 10 deg typically, also helps disentangling the signal from the noise background.     Figure 7- 12: Example of rotational measurement at 10 cm (central sensor) from the component under test; magnetic moment = 0 ,13 mAm2 In Figure 7-12, the black curve represents the calculated equivalent magneti c dipole signature, and the blue crosses represent the measurement points (every 2  deg). In spite of the noise, very clear sinusoidal signatures are obtained on each axis.  Smaller magnetic moments can be measured using gradiometers instead of magnetometers , or multiple magnetometers, or closed- loop earth -field compensation. However, below 10  μAm2, magnetic moments cannot be resolved any more using usual fluxgate magnetometers measurements and multi -channel SQUID magnetometers operated in a magnetically shie lded room are needed. In order to reject 1/f noise, a modulation procedure can be used, by moving the body/sample periodically with respect to the magnetic field sensor. In this way, the static or slowly varying magnetic fields are transposed to a frequenc y range where the measurement system is much more sensitive. The DC magnetic fields can be reconstructed from the measurement data using a demodulation procedure (similar to a digital lock -in procedure).

       " ['ECSS -Q-ST-70-80C 30 July 2021  18 4 Principles 4.1 General  Producing parts through metallic Powder Bed Fusion technologies occurs  frequently  during  the manufacture  of parts  for space  applications.  This  Standa rd specifies  the necessary  requirements  to perform  metallic Powder Bed Fusion processes for space  applications  (see Figure 4-1). Firstly, it is  comprised of three phases, as they typically occur during the de velopment of additively produced space hardware:  1. Within t he AM definition phase, hardware requirements are reviewed and compared with AM manufacturing constraints , allowing for an early assessment of the feasibility of the envisaged AM project. At this stage, it is clarified,  whether or not  an existing, verified AMP is applicable for the intended application. I f this is the case, the verification on specimen level in point 2 is not repeated, but t he verification on part level is then the next step.  2. The aim of the  verification phase i s to verify the AM end- to-end process through a dedicated test campaign on spec imen and part level. The verification on specimen -level results in the approved AMP . The HFP then summarises this two -stage verification on prototype -level and constitutes the basis for any hardware production. The intent of the AMP is to describe the intrinsic material properties and can therefore also be used for other designs.  3. In the  hardware production phase, the hardware is produced according to the HFP. The success of manufacturing and inspection is described in the HPR.  Additive Manufacturing proce sses are considered critical (see the definition of a critical process in ECSS -Q-ST-70) and many factors are known to have a substantial influence on the properties of the final product.

This  Standa rd specifies  the necessary  requirements  to perform  metallic Powder Bed Fusion processes for space  applications  (see Figure 4-1). Firstly, it is  comprised of three phases, as they typically occur during the de velopment of additively produced space hardware:  1. Within t he AM definition phase, hardware requirements are reviewed and compared with AM manufacturing constraints , allowing for an early assessment of the feasibility of the envisaged AM project. At this stage, it is clarified,  whether or not  an existing, verified AMP is applicable for the intended application. I f this is the case, the verification on specimen level in point 2 is not repeated, but t he verification on part level is then the next step.  2. The aim of the  verification phase i s to verify the AM end- to-end process through a dedicated test campaign on spec imen and part level. The verification on specimen -level results in the approved AMP . The HFP then summarises this two -stage verification on prototype -level and constitutes the basis for any hardware production. The intent of the AMP is to describe the intrinsic material properties and can therefore also be used for other designs.  3. In the  hardware production phase, the hardware is produced according to the HFP. The success of manufacturing and inspection is described in the HPR.  Additive Manufacturing proce sses are considered critical (see the definition of a critical process in ECSS -Q-ST-70) and many factors are known to have a substantial influence on the properties of the final product. Therefore, after the here above described development phases, three clauses , namely clause 9 “AM operation and supervision personnel ”, 10 “Equipment and facilities ”, and 11',\n",

First, the preliminary Additive Manufacturing Procedure (pAMP) is established, defining acceptable powder characteristics, AM machine operation parameters, AM machine processing window (s), post processing parameters (e.g. pressure and working distance for jet blasting or heat treatment parameters), and NDT  techniques. These parameters are then verified through rather low -cost tests (e.g. density cubes and tensile tests). Once the resu lt of these are acceptable, the pAMP is established. After having established the pAMP, it is verified  on specimen level (AMP), and on prototype level (HFP). The main principle is that  preliminary procedures  (pAMP and pHFP) are converted to verified procedures (AMP and HFP) through dedicated test campaigns (AMVP and PVP).

It is important u nder this condition, to derive the information on joint strength and stiffness and variation from similar tests carried out at normal ambient to be noted. 16.3.3.7 Creep Testing  Creep of joints can significantly reduce the preload over time. Loss of preload can  be caused by creep of materials in the join t interface such as thermal spacers, CFRP, peelable shims, thermal fillers , etc. It is important to consider creep testing in accordance with the relevant environmental conditions, in particular for thermal exposure and thermal cycling.  16.3.3.8 Vibration Loosening  One objective of proto -flight or acceptance dynamic testing (sine, random, acoustic) is to verify, that the bolted junctions are not loosening under vibration loads.  16.4 Production Testing  It is unlikely that individual joints are production tested. It is far more likely that the joints are tested as part of an overall spacecraft structural test. Obviously, normal quality control procedures aim to ensure that the production joint resembles the joint development tested within expected production tolerances.  When a production test procedure is used, there is no need to use a  test factor. It ensures freedom for each part from both proof and ultimate failures up to the level of  the production test load. It is important that the production test load specified is  set at the specified proof load where the component is designed'],\n",

       "  'ECSS -Q-ST-70-80C 30 July 2021  21 5.2 Safety classification of AM parts  5.2.1  Overview  Additively manufactured parts  for space applications are classified into four  classes according to their function and requirements using safety cat egories  (see clause 5.2.2 ). Different considerations are  made for the classification.  For example, loaded parts subjected to a max imum  Von Mises stress > 50  % of the yield strength (Fty in tensile) or > 25  % of the ultimate strength (Ftu in tensile) of the material, or if in human spaceflight and subjected to fracture control, are likely considered structural in this context.  Another example is pressurized hardware des igned primarily for the storage of pressurized fluid with an energy level greater than or equal to 19310 Joule, or with an internal pressure greater than or equal to 0,69 MPa, or which can create a hazard (if released) are also likely considered structural . Items with an energy level below 19310 Joule can still be considered as structural, unless for instance verified as Leak Before Burst (LBB), to mitigate the risk of catastrophic rupture (see ECSS -E-ST-32-01), although those are sometimes still considered  safety critical, even if not fracture critical . 5.2.2  Definition of AM safety classes 5.2.2.1  Safety Class 1.1 parts Are considered critical  and structural.  Failure  of a Class  1.1 part results  in a loss of spacecraft, major components, loss  of life, or loss of control of  the spacecraft.  5.2.2.2  Safety Class 1.2 parts Are critical, but non -structural. Failure of a Class 1.2 part results in loss of spacecraft, major components, loss of life, or los s of control of the spacecraft.  5.2.2.3  Safety Class 2 parts  Are non -critical but structural. Their failure can reduce the efficiency of the system but not cause the loss of the spacecraft.  5.2.2.4  Safety Class 3 parts  Are non -critical and  non- structural and  are contained  so that failure  does  not'],\n",
